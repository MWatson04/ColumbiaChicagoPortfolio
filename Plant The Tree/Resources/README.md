NOTE: 
I don't own nor did I personally create any of the resources used for this project. 
They are all resources I found and downloaded through various sources on the internet. 
I am simply using them to create a more visually appealing demonstration of this project.

I also remembered that I have the links to the websites I found the resources on stored in the bio of this games
itch.io page.
