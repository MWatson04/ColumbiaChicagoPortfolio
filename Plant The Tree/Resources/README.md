NOTE: 
I don't own nor did I personally create any of the resources used for this project. 
They are all resources I found and downloaded through various sources on the internet. 
I am simply using them to create a more visually appealing demonstration of this project.

I was also able to find the links to the websites where I downloaded the resources I used.
