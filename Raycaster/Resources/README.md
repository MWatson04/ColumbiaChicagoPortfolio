NOTE:
The "Textures.png" and "all_textures.png" files in the Textures folder contain textures that were not created by me.
I downloaded them from the internet and while I did modify some of the textures (shown in "all_textures.png"), 
I still do not claim those to be mine. They were only adjusted and used to fit my needs for the project. 

NOTE 2:
The file in the TextureArrays folder contains an integer array for all of the rgb values for all of the
textures in the "all_textures.png" file. This is what I actually used in my project, so I included it in
my resources folder to make note that it is just an integer version of the textures seen in this project.
