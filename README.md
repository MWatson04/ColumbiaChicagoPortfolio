The 3 games I made in for my portfolio are named, "The Endless Fight", "Plant The Tree", and "Duel To The Death".
 For the files containing each games respective code, they will be prefixed with abbreviated versions of the name of each game. 
 "The Endless Fight" code files will be prefixed with "tef", "Plant The Tree" code files will be prefixed with "plt",
 and the "Duel To The Death" code file will be prefixed with "dttd".
