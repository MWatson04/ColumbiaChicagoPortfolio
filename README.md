This repository contains the code for 3 projects that I have worked on (separated into folders) as well as any other files that go with each program.
This includes any resources such as audio and art that I didn't create and any downloadable files for the programs.

The projects in this repository include Plant The Tree, somewhat of a Super Mario clone made in Unity with C#, 
Space Blasters, a Space Invaders clone made in VS Community 2019 and made with C++ and SFML, and 
Raycaster, a game engine that utilizes raycasting and made with C++ and OpenGL.
