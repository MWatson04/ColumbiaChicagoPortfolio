The 3 games I made in for my portfolio are named, "The Endless Fight", "Plant The Tree", and "The Wizards Duel".
For the files containing each games respective code, they will be prefixed with abbreviated versions of the name of each game. 
"The Endless Fight" code files will be prefixed with "tef", "Plant The Tree" code files will be prefixed with "plt",
and the "The Wizards Duel" code file will be prefixed with "twd".
